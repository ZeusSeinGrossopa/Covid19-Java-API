# Covid19-Java-Api 

The Covid19-API is a useful tool for getting a overview about the covid19 cases 

This API is based on the [COVID-19 API](https://corona-zahlen.org)

### How it works

The API works with the [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library to collect the information with a simple data class.
